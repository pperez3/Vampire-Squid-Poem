Vampire Squid and the Cuttlerfish 

If a Squid found itself on the web
How would form itself to social media 
How would it change it RNA to disguise into cyberspace.

Would find a home in an empty space where lost data float freely
Feeding on the meaningless words to sites with no viewer
If an intruder found its way on how would the squid defend itself 
As a hacker or an AI what phenomenon could it utilize
Would it send miscellaneous symbols that would confuse the other
Would it produce ads, porn, or conspirsey theory trailored to the other

The Cuttlerfish is a bootleg copy of a websites.
